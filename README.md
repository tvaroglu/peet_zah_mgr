### Technical Choices
This application was built with Ruby on Rails to leverage its proven MVC architecture, thereby ensuring a clean separation of concerns between data models, business logic, and UI presentation layers.

Key benefits driving the technical design choices included:

1.) ActiveRecord ORM: Simplifies database interactions and relationships while maintaining readability. Associations between pizzas and toppings can be easily modeled without complex SQL and potential risk of SQL injection.

2.) Validations at multiple logical layers: Rails models enforce business rules in code, while PostgreSQL constraints ensure data integrity at the schema level. This dual-layer validation prevents duplicate records, preserves data integrity, and ultimately the end user experience.

3.) Built-in MVC convention: Rails‚Äô opinionated structure accelerates development and enforces code maintainability by keeping models, controllers, and views abstracted and well organized within relevant subdirectories.

4.) Lightweight, flexible views: TailwindCSS was paired with built-in Rails views for rapid, iterative UI development. This approach provides out of the box responsiveness while allowing for quicker design adjustments as requirements eventually evolve and applications reach greater maturity.

5.) Rails‚Äô convention-over-configuration philosophy paired with a strong automated testing ecosystem (RSpec, Capybara) allows the application to achieve high maintainability, faster iteration cycles, and production-ready quality in a short timeframe.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Environment Setup

### Requirements:
- macOS or Linux (arm64 supported)
- [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

### Suggested `~/.zshrc` Configuration:
```bash
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(rbenv init -)"

# Avoid Rails/Logger conflicts in Rails 7.x with RSpec 5.x versions:
export RUBYOPT="-rlogger"

# Node version management:
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && . "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && . "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"

# Homebrew Postgres binary management:
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"
```

### Install dependencies, build app, run tests, and local server:
```bash
# Install dependencies:
bundle install

# Create && migrate database:
bin/rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed

# Compile Tailwind assets:
bin/rails tailwindcss:build
